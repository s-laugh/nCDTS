# Centrally Deployed Templates Solution (CDTS) 2.0 Notes

This is a repository to help plan the future CDTS code base. Adding notes here and testing out new ideas.

This project is based on the idea by Stan Grabinski in [Next Centrally Deployed Templates Solution (nCDTS)](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/stan_grabinski/Next_Centrally_Deployed_Templates_Solution)

## Ideas

* [ ] node.js
* [ ] webpack
* [ ] open source
* [ ] automated testing
* [ ] automated deploy using CI
* [ ] generating example pages (documentation)
  * [ ] using assemble.io
* [ ] licensing (MIT, ISC, etc?)
* [ ] babel
* [ ] Way for developer to choose what version to use (in json, path or other way) 
  * [ ] way to maintain it (git branch, git label, git releases)
